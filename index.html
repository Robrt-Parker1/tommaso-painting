            <p>Keeping your home well-maintained includes knowing when to refresh its paint. Whether it’s the walls inside your home or the exterior facade, repainting can enhance its appearance and protect surfaces from damage. Many homeowners wonder how often they should repaint their homes. The answer depends on factors like the quality of the previous paint job, exposure to elements, and the type of surfaces being painted. If you are considering a <b><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?cid=16296562538535898449">Painting Service in Macomb MI</a></b></b>, understanding the right repainting schedule can help you maintain a beautiful and durable home.</p>

            <h2>How Often Should You Repaint Interior Walls?</h2>
            <p>Interior walls generally require repainting every 3 to 7 years, depending on the level of wear and tear. High-traffic areas, such as hallways and living rooms, may need fresh coats more frequently. A professional interior painter</b> can recommend the best type of paint based on the room’s usage. Using high-quality, washable paint can extend the lifespan of your walls while keeping them looking fresh and clean.</p>

            <h2>When to Repaint Ceilings</h2>
            <p>Ceilings do not require repainting as often as walls but may need an update every 10 to 15 years. Factors such as smoke, humidity, and dust accumulation can make ceilings look dull over time. Hiring a skilled painter</b> ensures that ceiling paint is applied evenly and lasts longer.</p>

            <h2>How Long Does Kitchen and Bathroom Paint Last?</h2>
            <p>Kitchens and bathrooms endure more moisture and stains than other rooms, requiring repainting every 3 to 5 years. The heat, grease, and humidity in these areas can cause paint to break down faster. Using mold-resistant and high-quality semi-gloss paint can help maintain the appearance of these spaces.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When Should You Repaint Bedrooms?</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How Often Should Doors and Trim Be Painted?</h2>
            <p>Doors, baseboards, and trim are subject to constant use and may need repainting every 2 to 4 years. These areas collect dust, fingerprints, and scuffs over time. Using durable, high-gloss or semi-gloss paint can help keep them looking fresh.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When Should You Repaint Your Home’s Exterior?</h2>

            <h2>How Long Does Paint Last on Wood Siding?</h2>
